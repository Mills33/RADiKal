# RADiKal 
Software package that processes and visualises RADSeq data to show the genetic diversity of a population (currently not a finished package)

[Draft]

Currently the scripts that make up RADiKal take raw unprocessed RAD reads and create painted chromosomes (see below) which gives and indication about the genetic variation present in the population. RADiKal produces several plots which all contribute to understanding the genetic diversity in a population.

RADiKal uses kmers.
